_________________

Hey! Iâ€²m Oliver, a 23-year old Software Engineer. My hobbies include music, coding, and snowsports.

I design and develop modern, high-performance C++ and Python codes. I began coding as early as 11 years old, starting out with Scratch and Python, but my passion for coding really flourished while studying my undergraduate in Theoretical Physics. This passion inspired me to study my Computer Science MSc at the University of Warwick. Since then, coding has been my main hobby and career path.
