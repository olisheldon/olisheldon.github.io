# [**Advent of Code 2024**](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

`Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.`

The pages found below document my solutions to the 2024 Advent of Code puzzles written in Python. These pages describe the problems, discuss my thought process, and detail my solutions to them. Within each page I also provide a critique of my solution in terms of computational efficiency and software quality.
