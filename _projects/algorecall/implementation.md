# Implementation Details

## Project Architecture

## Core Components

### Spaced Repetition Engine
The heart of the application is the SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm implementation:

- **Interval Calculation**: Dynamically adjusts review intervals based on user performance
- **Difficulty Rating**: User-provided difficulty ratings (1-5) influence scheduling
- **Ease Factor**: Tracks how easy each problem is for the user
- **Due Date Management**: Automatic calculation of when problems should be reviewed

### Authentication System
- Google OAuth integration with Firebase Authentication
- Secure token management and refresh
- User profile management
- Privacy-focused data handling

### Real-time Data Sync
- Firestore for real-time database operations
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Offline support with conflict resolution
- Cross-device synchronization

## Key Algorithms

 - SM-2 Spaced Repetition
 - Problem Recommendation Engine

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting
- Lazy loading of components and routes
- Dynamic imports for better initial load times
- Bundle analysis and optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Intelligent caching of problem data
- Background sync for data updates

### Database Optimization
- Pagination for large datasets
- Efficient data models for real-time updates

## Security Implementation

 -  Firebase Security Rules
 -  Input Validation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Jest for component testing
- Mock service worker for API testing
- Coverage reporting and thresholds

### Integration Tests
- Firebase emulator for local testing
- End-to-end user journey testing
- Performance testing with Lighthouse

### Accessibility Testing
- Automated accessibility checks
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation testing
