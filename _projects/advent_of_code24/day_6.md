## Description

This problem involves simulating a guard's patrol route in a 2D grid. The guard follows a simple set of rules:
1. If there is an obstacle directly ahead, turn 90 degrees right
2. Otherwise, move forward one step

The input is a grid where '^' represents the guard's starting position (facing up), '#' represents obstacles, and '.' represents empty spaces.

## Part 1

Part 1 asks us to count how many distinct positions the guard visits before leaving the mapped area. This is a straightforward simulation problem that requires:

1. Finding the guard's initial position
2. Implementing the movement rules
3. Tracking visited positions
4. Detecting when the guard leaves the grid

The solution uses `itertools.cycle` to handle the rotation of directions elegantly, cycling through up, right, down, and left movements. A set is used to track visited positions efficiently.

## Part 2

Part 2 asks us to find how many different positions we could place a new obstacle that would cause the guard to get stuck in a loop. This builds on Part 1 by:

1. Finding all possible positions for the new obstacle (empty spaces)
2. For each position:
   - Temporarily placing an obstacle
   - Running the simulation to detect if it creates a loop
   - Removing the obstacle

The key insight is that a loop exists if we encounter the same state (position + direction) twice. We track states as tuples of (row, col, dr, dc) where (dr, dc) represents the current direction.

## Improvements

While the current solution is sufficient for the given input sizes, potential optimizations could include:

- Using a more efficient data structure for state tracking
- Parallelizing the obstacle placement simulations in Part 2
- Early termination of simulations that clearly won't result in loops

### Algorithms

The solution uses:
- Grid traversal with direction vectors
- State tracking using sets
- Cycle detection for Part 2
